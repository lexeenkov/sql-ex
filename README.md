# sql-ex
Decided to publish my playing around with *sql-ex.ru* exercises.

The OLD file contains queries for the exercises from 1 to 55. I've done them during the semester as they were mandatory for one of the courses.
I've came back to SQL-EX after a year, when I was studiying in Slovakia and needed a push and practice of the SQL. I'll continue posting them as I complete them and I hope this repo will stay alive at least for the couple of upcoming months. By now, thanks for the attention.
