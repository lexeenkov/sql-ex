# sql-ex
Decided to publish my playing around with *sql-ex.ru* exercises.

The OLD file contains queries for the exercises from 1 to 55. I've done them during the semester as they were mandatory for one of the courses.
I've came back to SQL-EX after a year, when I was studiying in Slovakia and needed a push and practice of the SQL. I'll continue posting them as I complete them and I hope this repo will stay alive at least for the couple of upcoming months. By now, thanks for the attention.

I'm currently planning to divide exercises on databases, so I only work with one base at a time and don't have to switch every 10 minutes. "Airport" is a pleasure to work with and I''l concentrate on it for the upcoming days.
